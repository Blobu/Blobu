Hi there! This README is designed to be a "living" game interface.

👾 The Manifesto: No Masks.

I don't do this for the money. If you're looking for a corporate code monkey to optimize your microtransactions, you're in the wrong dungeon. I build games because reality is boring and I want to fix it.

I am a student of the craft, obsessively grinding XP to build experiences that linger in the player's psyche long after they've quit to desktop. My code is messy, my ambition is dangerous, and my passion is absolute. I'm here to make a dent in the universe, one pixel at a time.

⚔️ The Skill Tree (Inventory)

I don't list "skills." I list weapons I use to slay bugs and build worlds.
